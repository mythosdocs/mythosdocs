# Introduction to MythOS

## What is MythOS?

MythOS is a dynamic simulation engine and operating layer that enables the creation and management of autonomous AI agents. These agents operate within programmable, rule-based environments that model complex social systems—such as teams, organizations, or even entire societies. Unlike traditional chatbots, MythOS agents are self-learning entities equipped with memory, contextual awareness, and structured tools for action, powered by the Model-Context-Protocol (MCP) standard.

MythOS is designed to simulate real-world scenarios with high fidelity, allowing users to observe how agents evolve, interact, and make decisions in response to changing conditions. It’s a tool for exploring "what-if" scenarios, testing hypotheses, and prototyping solutions in a digital sandbox before real-world implementation.

## Who is MythOS For?

MythOS is built for:

- **Founders and Entrepreneurs**: Simulate team dynamics, leadership decisions, or startup strategies under various market conditions.
- **Strategists and Analysts**: Test decision-making frameworks or behavioral models in controlled, repeatable environments.
- **Researchers**: Study emergent behaviors, social structures, or value systems in digital societies.
- **Developers and Innovators**: Build custom simulations or integrate MythOS into larger AI-driven systems.

Whether you're modeling a high-stakes corporate merger or a hypothetical tribal society, MythOS provides the flexibility to create, observe, and iterate.
