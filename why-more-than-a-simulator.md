# Why MythOS is More Than a Simulator

MythOS transcends traditional simulation tools by offering a programmable social cognition engine. Here’s what sets it apart:

## Adaptive, Non-Scripted Agents

Unlike scripted NPCs in games or rule-based bots, MythOS agents learn and evolve. They don’t follow predetermined paths but instead adapt based on interactions, memory, and environmental feedback. This leads to emergent behaviors that mirror real-world complexity.

## MCP as a Standard

The Model-Context-Protocol (MCP) standard is the backbone of MythOS, providing:

- **Externalized Intelligence**: Agents rely on modular tools rather than hardcoded logic, making them lightweight and extensible.
- **Modularity**: New tools or servers can be added without redesigning the system.
- **Traceability**: Every action is logged and auditable, enabling detailed analysis of decision-making processes.
- **Scalability**: MCP servers can handle large populations of agents across distributed environments.

## A Platform for Digital Societies

MythOS is not just about simulating isolated scenarios—it’s a foundation for modeling entire digital societies. By combining programmable rules with autonomous agents, MythOS enables users to explore how values, norms, and structures emerge over time.
